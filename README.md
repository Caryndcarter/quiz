# Python Quiz

## Description

This application was created in order to offer learners of Python a quiz to test their knowledge of Python syntax.  It was created using the MERN stack: Node.js, JavaScript, React as the front-end framework, with MongoDB as the database.  Users are given random mutiple choice questions from a list and their score tallied at the end.  

The application uses GithubActions to run Cypress Tests on the "develop" branch upon a pull request to develop.  Another GithubAction deploys the application to Render when a push is made to the "main" branch.
